# web-template

I plan to stores some useful templates when developing a single page apps with popular frameworks.
The purpose is to avoid search answers on internet or books when someone needs these building blocks.

For example, angular-with-d3js shows how to use d3js through directive angular1.
It's reuseable and can be modified into other kinds of charts.
